 *
 * You are given an integer hoursBefore, the number of hours you have to travel
 * to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n
 * roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n,
 * where dist[i] describes the length of the i^th road in kilometers. In
 * addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you
 * will travel at.
 *
 * After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour
 * before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have
 * to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the
 * meeting.
 *
 *
 * For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2
 * hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly
 * 2Â hours, you do not need to wait.
 *
 *
 * However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time,
 * meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this
 * means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.
 *
 *
 * For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling
 * the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will
 * mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting
 * you start traveling the third road immediately.
 *
 *
 * Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on
 * time, or -1 if it is impossible.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: dist = [1,3,2], speed = 4, hoursBefore = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (1/4 + 3/4) + (3/4 + 1/4) +
 * (2/4) = 2.5 hours.
 * You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) =
 * 1.5 hours.
 * Note that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the
 * second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) +
 * (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.
 * You can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) +
 * ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 1, hoursBefore = 10
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: It is impossible to arrive at the meeting on time even if you
 * skip all the rests.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == dist.length
 * 1 <= n <= 1000
 * 1 <= dist[i] <= 10^5
 * 1 <= speed <= 10^6
 * 1 <= hoursBefore <= 10^7
